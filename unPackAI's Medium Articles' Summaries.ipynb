    "\n",
    "    According to Arthur Samuel, the term Machine learning means the ability of computers to learn on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, it’s crazy how a computer can learn by itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Machine learning is just a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to “learn” from some experience and develop on their own without having to be directly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Learning for humans means finding knowledge either by going to school and being trained by a teacher, either by self-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer also uses the same way to learn; it must find data that need to be trained by someone(supervised) or can train itself(unsupervised).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are often classified as supervised or unsupervised learning.\n",
    "    Supervised learning means to be trained by a teacher; in other words, the computer program needs to learn from the data and its target.\n",
    "    Unsupervised learning means the computer doesn’t need to be trained by someone (Self-training). In this case, the computer program learns from data without a target.\n",
    "    Reinforcement Learning means the computer will learn from the mistakes of different trials. It’s like when a child doesn’t go to school and doesn’t learn independently but keeps taking the exam. Of course, there is 100% that he will continue to fail unless he is a genius or a gifted one. However, he can learn from the different exams he has taken and maybe finally pass the exam.\n",

    "Supervised Learning\n",
    "As we have seen previously, supervised needs data and its target; therefore, based on the specific target, two types of supervised learning exist Regression and Classification.\n",
